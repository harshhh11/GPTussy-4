# GPTussy-4

A Discord bot that integrates with OpenAI's GPT-4 model to generate responses to user messages. The bot listens to messages in a specific channel and respond with messages generated by GPT.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the root directory
2. Install the required packages using npm install
3. Create a .env file in the root directory and add the following variables:
```shell
TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token
API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
```

## Usage

Once the bot is running, it will listen for messages in a specific channel, which is defined in the if statement in the MessageCreate Listener. You can change the channel ID to any channel in your Discord server.

When a message is received, the bot will send it to GPT for processing and generate a response. If the response is longer than 2000 characters (the maximum length of a Discord message), it will split the response into multiple messages.
